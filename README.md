# Jamboree-Admission-Analysis-and-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts graduate admission chances using academic metrics like GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, and research experience. Built with linear regression and real-world data from Jamboree.
# 🎓 Graduate Admission Prediction - Jamboree Analysis
---

## 📊 Insights

- **GRE Score, TOEFL Score, and CGPA** showed strong correlation with the chance of admission.
- Students with **research experience** tend to have a significantly higher chance of being admitted.
- **University Rating** and **SOP (Statement of Purpose)** scores had moderate influence.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

- Explore the relationship between test scores, academic credentials, and admission chances.
- Build a **linear regression model** to estimate a student's likelihood of admission.
- Provide interpretable results for students and advisors.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- The dataset size was relatively small, limiting the model's generalizability.
- Features like SOP, LOR, and University Rating are subjective and can vary widely between institutions.
- Some columns contained whitespace in headers, requiring preprocessing.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Incorporate **more complex models** like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for higher accuracy.
- Use **larger datasets** from multiple institutions for better generalization.
- Add features like **extracurriculars**, **internship experience**, and **target schools**.
- Deploy as a **web application** for student use with interactive inputs.
